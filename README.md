# Introduction
This is a personal related project. I conducted an analysis on a dataset that I generated to monitor students progress in technical drawing from the first to the third term of the session. The dataset contained 153 rows and 26 columns. The following variables are included in the data;

a) Student Name: The name of the student

b) Class: The class each student belong, either science 1 or science 2

c) CA_1a: The score of the first continous assessment in first term

d) Total_CA2: The total score of continous assessment in second term

e) Total_Score3: The sum of score in continous assessment and exam in third term

f) Weighted average: The average of total scores in first, second and third term.

The aim of the research is to derive significant insights that will guide teaching improvement on the basics of technical drawing.
